    "# Mixed-Precision Compression Post-Training Quantization + Conversion to IMX500 of a ShuffleNetV2 PyTorch Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use the [**Model Compression Toolkit (MCT)**](https://github.com/sony/model_optimization) for model quantization and compression under certain HW constraints (e.g. memory). This is done using MCT's mixed-precision API that assigns different bit-widths to different weights and activations in the quantized model. After the model is quantized to a specific size, it will be converted to a binary format suitable to load to IMX500 using the [**IMX500-converter**](https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/raspberrypi-ai-camera/documentation/imx500-converter?version=3.14.3&progLang=). \n",
    "\n",
    "This example is not intended to demonstrate evaluating MCT PTQ performance and as such intentionally uses generated random data to speed up the process.\n",
